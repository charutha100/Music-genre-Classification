# Music-genre-Classification

The music genre classification project demonstrated the power of feature engineering and preprocessing for audio-based classification tasks.

By cleaning the dataset, scaling numerical features, and visualizing patterns, a solid foundation was set for genre prediction.

Feature correlations and genre imbalances were explored through comprehensive EDA. 

This sets the stage for building effective classification models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest for genre prediction.

Random Forest serves better accuracy for this particular dataset
